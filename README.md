# cookie-clicker

This is a simple cookie clicker style game with potatoes as the theme.
The main features,
increasing the potato count by clicking the potato,
buy upgrades from the shop to increase the potatoes gained per second using the potatoes farmed so far,
local storage features implemented so the game saves per click, per upgarde purchased and just in case every second, and will reload current counters and options upon reload,
sound effects for clicking on the potato and upgrades, with a checkbox options to enable/disable,
the game is suitable for desktop but is a wip for mobile as this came as an afterthought and working backwards became a challenge against time.

to run you will need a modern browser then clone the repository
in your terminal
git clone https://github.com/taylor1807/cookie-clicker.git
cd cookie-clicker
then open the index.html in your prefered browser

then start clicking - click on the smiling potato to start farming potatoes
once you have enough - buy upgardes using the potatoes you have farmed so far (upgrades will increase in price the more you buy so purchase wisely)
there is also an options menu to enable/disable sound and also reset your progress(be careful this cannot be undone)

Thank you to [Cookie Upgrade API](https://cookie-upgrade-api.vercel.app/) for providing upgrade data.And w3schools/mdn/stackoverflow for guides on how to add soundeffects, create an options box, modify the upgrade cost after each purchase, and adding animations.

overall this project has been a fun experience, i hope you enjoy it too.
